                <h2>Where is the World of Games heading?</h2>
                <p>In 2025, the gaming landscape is defined by a shift from static play to persistent, interconnected ecosystems. Powered by advanced HTML5 technologies like WebGL 2.0 and WebAssembly, modern browser-based games now deliver near-native performance and high-quality 3D visuals without requiring external plugins or installations. This evolution is driven by the rise of cloud gaming, allowing players to stream resource-heavy titles directly to any device, and the integration of Generative AI, which creates dynamic NPCs and personalized narratives that adapt to individual player behavior. As the global player base approaches 3.6 billion, the industry is moving beyond simple entertainment, transforming into a dominant social hub for community-led events, digital economies, and immersive mixed-reality experiences.</p>
